This project is an open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer network. This is a server-side component for Linux-based systems which builds network infrastructure.

## What does it do?
This project finds other users and communicates with them for **building the whole virtual network**. In other words, that project makes a **private network inside the Internet**.

## Features:
- It is **fully anonymous**: This project uses own implementation of garlic routing.
- It is **fully decentralized**: Each node of this network is an independent router.
- It helps to **send encrypted private packages** to any network's member.
- It has **own protocol** of transporting on the application layer.
- It is not afraid of local authority censorship filters.
- It is **automatically adapts and sets up**.

## What is it for?
The Garlic Network is intended for engineers and enthusiasts looking to build a new safe project based on TGN.

Thanks to decentralization nature, this project is a great foundation for developers who built applications with security and reliability in mind. It can be literally anything: from a simple instant messaging app to own private network with onion routing.

There is a simple C/C++ library for building your own project based on TGN - [libgarlic](https://github.com/The-Garlic-Network/libgarlic).
